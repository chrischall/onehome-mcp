# OneHome MCP

OneHome is a CoreLogic product. Buyers reach it through a private magic-link URL their real-estate agent emailed (`https://portal.onehome.com/.../?token=...`). It's an Angular SPA backed by a single GraphQL API at `services.onehome.com/graphql`.

This skill drives the `onehome-mcp` tools (`onehome_*`) — all GraphQL-bound except for the local PITI / affordability calculators.

## When to use

- The user mentions OneHome, a portal.onehome.com URL, or a CoreLogic magic-link they got from their agent.
- They ask about listings in a specific "group" their agent set up (Lake Lure, downtown condos, etc.).
- They want to look up a listing by MLS number or address and the other realty MCPs returned nothing.
- They want photos, school info, or to compare two OneHome listings.

If the user asks generally about a property without naming OneHome, prefer one of the public-listing MCPs (zillow / redfin / homes / compass) first.

## Auth modes

The MCP picks one at startup:

1. `ONEHOME_TOKEN` (env): raw bearer JWT.
2. `ONEHOME_MAGIC_LINK` (env): full URL with `?token=`. The token IS the bearer.
3. fetchproxy capture: capture from a signed-in `portal.onehome.com` tab.

Run `onehome_healthcheck` first to confirm auth is wired up — it returns the mode, token expiry (when known), and a one-line hint.

## Workflow

1. **Pick a group.** `onehome_get_groups` → the curated buckets the agent shared with the buyer. Most tools take a `group_id`.
2. **Search inside the group.** `onehome_search_properties { group_id, [saved_search_id] }`. Pass a `saved_search_id` from `onehome_get_saved_searches` to apply a saved filter; leave it off for the group default.
3. **Inflate a listing.** `onehome_get_property { group_id, listing_id }` for the full record. The listing id is an OSK like `EYxOzZSAbCdEf12345`; you can pass a portal URL instead and the MCP will extract it.
4. **Photos / schools / walkability** are separate calls. Use the lat/lng from `onehome_get_property` to drive `onehome_get_schools` and `onehome_get_walk_score`.
5. **Compare** `onehome_compare_properties { group_id, targets: [...] }` — 2 to 8 listings, concurrent fetch, per-row error capture. Don't fan out manual `get_property` calls when comparing.
6. **Escape hatch.** `onehome_graphql` lets you send a raw document with variables when you need a field the structured tools don't expose. Common operation names: `GetOneHomeUser`, `GetListings`, `GetPins`, `ListingById`, `MediaListingById`, `GetSavedSearches`, `ListingSuggestionsSearch`, `GetLocalLogicSchools`.

## Free-text search

`onehome_search_suggestions { query }` bypasses the group / saved-search structure. Use it when the user knows what they're looking for (MLS number, address, partial street name) but doesn't care which group it lives in.

## Local computation

`onehome_calculate_mortgage` and `onehome_calculate_affordability` are pure local math — no network, no token needed. Use them when the user asks "what would my payment be on this place" or "what can I afford"; identical math to the other realty MCPs.

## Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting `group_id` on listing detail / photos.** Every listing surface is scoped to a group. If you have a listing id from `onehome_search_suggestions`, you still need a group id to inflate it. Pick the group most likely to contain it (usually the user's primary one).
- **Stale token.** OneHome JWTs expire. `onehome_healthcheck` shows `seconds_until_expiry`. Refresh the env var if it's close to zero.
- **fetchproxy capture mode + no interaction.** In capture mode, the MCP can't read the bearer until the user's tab fires a GraphQL request. If a call hangs there, ask the user to scroll the map / click a listing / refresh the portal page.
