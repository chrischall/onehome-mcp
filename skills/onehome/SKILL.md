# OneHome MCP

OneHome is a CoreLogic product. Buyers reach it through a private magic-link URL their real-estate agent emailed (`https://portal.onehome.com/.../?token=...`). It's an Angular SPA backed by a single GraphQL API at `services.onehome.com/graphql`.

This skill drives the `onehome-mcp` tools (`onehome_*`) — all GraphQL-bound except for the local PITI / affordability calculators.

## When to use

- The user mentions OneHome, a portal.onehome.com URL, or a CoreLogic magic-link they got from their agent.
- They ask about listings in a specific "group" their agent set up (Lake Lure, downtown condos, etc.).
- They want to look up a listing by MLS number or address and the other realty MCPs returned nothing.
- They want photos, school info, or to compare two OneHome listings.

If the user asks generally about a property without naming OneHome, prefer one of the public-listing MCPs (zillow / redfin / homes / compass) first.

## Auth modes

The MCP picks one at startup:

1. `ONEHOME_TOKEN` (env): raw bearer JWT.
2. `ONEHOME_MAGIC_LINK` (env): full URL with `?token=`. The token IS the bearer.
3. fetchproxy capture: capture from a signed-in `portal.onehome.com` tab.

Run `onehome_healthcheck` first to confirm auth is wired up — it returns the mode, token expiry (when known), and a one-line hint.

## Workflow

1. **Pick a group.** `onehome_get_groups` → the curated buckets the agent shared with the buyer. Most tools take a `group_id`.
2. **Search inside the group.** `onehome_search_properties { group_id, [saved_search_id] }`. Pass a `saved_search_id` from `onehome_get_saved_search` to apply a saved filter; leave it off for the group default. `onehome_get_saved_search_with_listings` returns the saved search and its inflated listings in one call.
3. **Inflate a listing.** `onehome_get_property { group_id, listing_id }` for the full record. The listing id is an OSK like `EYxOzZSAbCdEf12345`; you can pass a portal URL instead and the MCP will extract it.
4. **Photos / schools / walkability** are separate calls. Use the lat/lng from `onehome_get_property` to drive `onehome_get_schools` and `onehome_get_walk_score`.
5. **Compare** `onehome_compare_properties { group_id, targets: [...], view? }` — 2 to 8 listings, concurrent fetch, per-row error capture. Don't fan out manual `get_property` calls when comparing.
6. **Escape hatch.** `onehome_graphql { operation_name, query, variables?, view? }` lets you send a raw document when you need a field the structured tools don't expose. Common operation names: `GetOneHomeUser`, `GetListings`, `GetPins`, `ListingById`, `MediaListingById`, `GetSavedSearches`, `ListingSuggestionsSearch`. (LocalLogic schools / walk-score are REST endpoints, not GraphQL operations — use `onehome_get_schools` / `onehome_get_walk_score` instead.)

## Free-text search

`onehome_search_suggestions { query }` bypasses the group / saved-search structure. Use it when the user knows what they're looking for (MLS number, address, partial street name) but doesn't care which group it lives in.

## Local computation

`onehome_calculate_mortgage` and `onehome_calculate_affordability` are pure local math — no network, no token needed. Use them when the user asks "what would my payment be on this place" or "what can I afford"; identical math to the other realty MCPs.

## Response shape (`view`)

Four tools take `view: "compact" | "full"` — `onehome_get_by_address`,
`onehome_compare_properties`, `onehome_get_user` and `onehome_graphql` — and
**`compact` is the default**. You get the slim shape without asking for it;
an efficiency a caller has to request is one that is usually not requested.

**What compact does here is strip image and avatar URLs, and nothing else.**
There is no field projection, and none is claimed: this server hands OneHome's
payload back close to verbatim and holds no verified record of which of its
fields matter, so nothing here could honestly name a keep-list. Stripping media
is *subtractive* — it names what to remove, never what to keep — so it cannot
lose a field nobody anticipated. Every non-media field, at every depth,
survives compact untouched.

**The surprise is `onehome_graphql`.** Compact keeps every envelope key
(`data`, `errors`, `status`, `url`), but the strip reaches *inside* `data` —
and `MediaListingById`, one of the operation names this skill recommends, is
all media. OneHome nests its variants under an `Image` key, so at the default
rung each photo comes back as `{ Order, LongDescription }` with `Thumbnail`,
`Medium` and `Large` all gone: the call succeeds and returns nothing you asked
for. Pass `view: "full"` for any media query — and for any call you are making
*because* a payload was not what you expected, so a missing field is never this
server's doing.

`view: "full"` returns what the tool built with nothing removed. There is
deliberately **no `raw` rung**, for two different reasons: on `onehome_graphql`
`full` already *is* the unprojected upstream envelope, so a third value would
silently alias the second; and the other three assemble their record from a
query result plus derived fields, so there is no single upstream payload left
to hand back.

**The other seventeen tools take no `view` at all.** That is scope — a partial
rollout, not an oversight — but for two of them it is also correct on the
merits:

- `onehome_get_property_photos` exists to return exactly the URLs compact
  strips. Its product *is* the image; stripping there would not shrink the
  response, it would empty it. Never media-strip a tool whose name is the test.
- `onehome_calculate_mortgage` and `onehome_calculate_affordability` are local
  math returning a handful of numbers — already narrower than any projection.

## Common pitfalls

- **Forgetting `group_id` on listing detail / photos.** Every listing surface is scoped to a group. If you have a listing id from `onehome_search_suggestions`, you still need a group id to inflate it. Pick the group most likely to contain it (usually the user's primary one).
- **Stale token.** OneHome JWTs expire. `onehome_healthcheck` shows `seconds_until_expiry`. Refresh the env var if it's close to zero.
- **fetchproxy capture mode + no interaction.** In capture mode, the MCP can't read the bearer until the user's tab fires a GraphQL request. If a call hangs there, ask the user to scroll the map / click a listing / refresh the portal page.
